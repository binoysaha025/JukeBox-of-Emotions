üéµ JukeBox of Emotions

A React web application that recommends Spotify albums based on your current emotional state. Instead of searching for specific artists, users select how they're feeling and discover new music that matches their mood.

7 Mood Categories: Happy, Sad, Anxious, Energetic, Romantic, Motivated, and Nostalgic
Smart Recommendations: Uses Spotify's search algorithm with curated keywords for each mood
Real-time Results: Fetches live album data from Spotify Web API
Responsive Design: Works seamlessly on desktop and mobile devices
Direct Spotify Links: Click through to listen on Spotify

üõ†Ô∏è Technologies Used

React.js - Frontend framework with hooks (useState, useEffect)
Spotify Web API - Music data and album recommendations
React Bootstrap - UI components and responsive design
JavaScript ES6+ - Modern JavaScript features

Direct Access: Users can click through to listen on Spotify

üéµ Project Inspiration
This project combines my interests in music and mental health awareness. Music has always been a powerful way to process emotions, and I wanted to create a tool that helps people discover new artists and albums based on their current emotional state rather than just searching by genre or artist name.
